               <p><b>The main objective</b> of creating this site is to provide educational materials to people in all parts of Nepal.
               It is convenient for people to purchase books with a single selection based on their preference.The online purchasing of books can be cost effective for the students and needy people.

               In a time when we sleep with our smartphones next to us and stare into our computer screens all day, what you share on social media tells a story about who you are and many canâ€™t resist telling a story about themselves as smart, worldly, and well-read.
            While the concept started with #bookstagramming the lofty collection at the book shop, Books Mandala has come a long way and is aiming create the largest community of book readers in Nepal.
